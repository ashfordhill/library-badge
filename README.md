# Library Badge

A Shields IO badge that displays my latest checked out book from SWAN libraries. 

Unfortunately there isn't an API for this so Playwright is used to navigate the login and scrape the data manually, making this fragile.

It would be neat to create some type of adapter system maybe as an NPM so people could implement their own library's 'last checked out book_name + book_title' data-grabbing (whether thru an API or Playwright like we have here).
